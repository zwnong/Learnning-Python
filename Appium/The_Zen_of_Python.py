The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters    # python哲学

Beautiful is better than ugly.  # 优美胜于丑陋
Explicit is better than implicit.   # 明了胜于晦涩
Simple is better than complex.  # 简单胜于复杂
Complex is better than complicated.    # 复杂胜于凌乱
Flat is better than nested.   # 扁平胜于嵌套
Sparse is better than dense.   # 间隔胜于紧凑 
Readability counts.     # 可读性很重要
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.  # 即使假借特例的实用性之名，也不能违背这些原则
Although practicality beats purity.    # 虽然实用性次于纯度
Errors should never pass silently.    # 错误不应该被忽略
Unless explicitly silenced.    # 除非明确的沉默
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.   # 当存在多种可能时，不要尝试去猜测
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.   # 应该只有一个，最好只有一个，很明显可用做到这一点
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.  # 虽然这种方式可能不容易，除非你是python之父
Now is better than never.   # 现在做总部不做好
Although never is often better than *right* now.    # 虽然过去从未比现在好
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.  # 如果这实现不容易解释，那么它肯定是个坏主意
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.    #如果这个实现很容易解释，那么它可能是个好主意
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!    # 空间命名是一种绝妙的理念，应当多加利用
